Real-time Multi-Face Recognition Attendance System
A Python-based attendance system that uses OpenCV for real-time face recognition to mark attendance. This project is designed to streamline attendance tracking in organizations or institutions. This is a real-time multiple face recognition attendance system. The database of this project can contain information about student/person's information. One can train the model by taking the photo samples and model is able to recognize it.

Features
Real-time face recognition using a webcam or CCTV feed.

Captures and stores face samples for training.

Generates attendance logs for recognized individuals.

User-friendly interface using Tkinter.

Secure and efficient attendance tracking.

Technologies Used
Python: For the core application logic.

OpenCV: For face detection and recognition.

Tkinter: For creating the GUI interface.

CSV: For storing attendance records.

NumPy: For array handling in image processing.
